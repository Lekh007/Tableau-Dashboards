Note that these dashboards have been generated using our current model with some randomized data 
like county, date of purchase. Along with other data for the model to generate 2000 randomized 
orders using 75 customers and do analysis on it. This was done on Jupyter Notebook.


The revenue dashboard allows the supermarket to understand the performance of the service and help
